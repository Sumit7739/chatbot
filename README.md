# 🏥 PROSPINE Chatbot – Your AI Medical Sidekick  

A chatbot that actually **knows** what it’s talking about—because it reads, scraps, and occasionally thinks. Unlike that one relative who thinks ginger tea cures everything.  

## 🧐 What’s This About?  
This chatbot is designed to **answer medical queries** with info pulled from PROSPINE’s website. It doesn’t just **make stuff up**—it uses:  
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** to scrape live medical data.  
- A **LLM (Large Language Model)** to generate responses that *sound like they know medicine*.  
- A **Google Drive info file** to stay informed, because memory is a luxury (even for AI).  

## 🚀 How to Set It Up?  
1. **Get an API key** – Because security is trendy.  
2. **Link a Google Drive info file** – So it doesn’t respond with “Uh, let me get back to you on that.”  
3. **Start asking questions** – Because figuring things out shouldn’t be harder than finding the Terms & Conditions checkbox.  

## 🏆 Why Use This?  
- **Faster than scrolling through endless medical articles.**  
- **More accurate than your cousin’s “just drink turmeric” advice.**  
- **No unnecessary small talk—just straight-up answers.**  

## ⚠️ Disclaimer  
This AI does **not** hand out medical degrees or replace actual doctors. It’s here to **help**, not diagnose your existential crises.
